# BIG-Calculator

Contains source code for a calculator which uses much bigger custom-made datatypes;
First Project;

====================================================================================

# Description

It is a naive attempt at creating a numerical datatype whose range can be arbitrarily adjusted. This custom datatype can be used for various mathematical and other purposes (for example, obtaining the digits of pi upto some decimal place). However, this is a simple project and there is no intention (yet) to release it as a software.
